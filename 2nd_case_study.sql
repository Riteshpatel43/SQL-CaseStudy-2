-- Case Study Questions: 
-- This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

-- Pizza Metrics
-- Runner and Customer Experience
-- Ingredient Optimisation
-- Pricing and Ratings
 
-- Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

-- Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones youâ€™d like to try!

-- Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!

-- 		A. Pizza Metrics
-- 1.How many pizzas were ordered?
-- 2.How many unique customer orders were made?
-- 3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
-- 4.How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
-- 5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
-- 6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
-- 7.For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
-- 8.How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
-- 9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
-- 10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?


-- 		B. Runner and Customer Experience
-- 1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
-- 2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
-- 3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
-- 4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
-- 5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
-- 6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
-- 7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
